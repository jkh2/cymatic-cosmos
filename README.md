## 🔬 The Science Behind the Magic

### Cymatic Visualization
The starfield uses real cymatic physics principles:
- **Frequency Analysis**: Your voice is analyzed across 32 frequency bands
- **Wave Interference**: Different frequencies create standing wave patterns
- **Node Formation**: Stars collect at stable points like sand on a vibrating plate
- **Tesla Effect**: Orbs create electromagnetic-like attraction fields

### Polyrhythmic Mathematics
- Each track follows a different rhythmic cycle
- Complex mathematical relationships create natural musical phrases
- Example: 4-beat + 3-beat cycles align every 12 beats
- Longer cycles (like 7 + 11) create evolving, hypnotic patterns

### Audio Engineering
- Built with Tone.js for professional synthesis
- Multi-stage audio processing (compression, limiting, reverb)
- Smooth envelopes prevent audio clicks and pops
- Harmonic generation based on music theory intervals

## 🎨 Visual Modes

### Rest Mode (No Mic Input)
- Stars spread naturally across the screen
- Gentle gravitational drift creates organic movement
- Tesla coil effects when orbs pass through starfield
- Peaceful, meditative atmosphere

### Voice Mode (With Mic Input)
- Stars form cymatic patterns based on your voice frequencies
- Different pitches create different geometric arrangements
- Real-time frequency spectrum analysis
- Sacred geometry emerges from sound
